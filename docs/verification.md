# turtles' own verification harness

turtles verifies itself with the same machinery it applies to other projects,
plus property-based tests and an end-to-end binary check:

1. **Unit tests** (`*_wbtest.mbt`) — deterministic behavior checks.
2. **Official QuickCheck PBT** (`*_pbt_wbtest.mbt`) —
   `moonbitlang/core/quickcheck` `@quickcheck.check` properties over pure
   invariants: fingerprints and identity tuples, kill attribution, regression
   templates, UTF-8 boundary construction, mutation application, mutation
   discovery, path filtering, and config round-tripping. The property suite is
   imported `for "wbtest"` only, so production builds never depend on it.
3. **Mutation testing** — turtles runs itself (see *Self-mutation* below).
4. **`scripts/self_e2e.sh`** — black-box check of the built binary's JSON
   report (see *Binary e2e* below).

## Self-mutation

The root `turtles.toml` is the checked-in self-verification config:

```toml
include = ["cmd/turtles/"]
```

Run it with a generous per-command timeout (each mutant pays a `moon check`
plus `moon test` of the whole module, including the property suite):

```sh
moon run cmd/turtles -- --dir . --timeout 300 --json target/turtles-self.json
```

`--jobs <n>` parallelizes across warm per-worker workspaces, and `--iterate`
reuses KILLED/UNVIABLE verdicts from a previous `.turtles/report.json` so
repeated self-runs stay cheap.

CI bounds the dogfood to `cmd/turtles/fingerprint.mbt` — a small file whose
three mutants are deterministic kills — so the gate stays fast while still
exercising the full pipeline: discovery, workspace copy, baseline, per-mutant
check + test, outcome attribution, and the JSON report.

### Survivors and the baseline

Expect some self-mutants to survive; that is the point of the exercise. When
triaging a self-run survivor, classify it rather than weakening operators or
hiding production files to reach green:

- **Equivalent mutant** — e.g. flipping an empty-input guard such as
  `if mutations.is_empty()`: the `cond → false` form only differs for modules
  without mutations, which the fixture sweep never produces. Document
  confirmed-equivalent survivors here.
- **Test gap** — the mutant changes observable behavior no test asserts on.
  Add coverage in `*_wbtest.mbt` (or extend `scripts/self_e2e.sh` assertions
  for binary-level behavior) rather than excluding the file.
- **Unobservable** — purely cosmetic output mutations (progress counters,
  formatting) that no gate observes. Tolerable; document them here.

## Binary e2e

`scripts/self_e2e.sh` runs `moon run cmd/turtles` against `fixtures/basic`
and validates the JSON report (schema, six fixture mutants, zero
survivors/timeouts/unviables). It catches defects unit tests miss — a binary
that exits successfully but produces a wrong report fails the assertions.

The script runs the fixture sweep twice with different `--json` targets so
both `mkdir` flag mutants in report writing stay reachable: the first report
lands in an existing directory (a dropped `allow_exist=true` fails), the
second in a nested non-existent directory (a dropped `recursive=true` fails).

Because the script targets the *current* working directory's binary, running
it inside a mutated workspace — as a custom gate command once per-mutant
command gates exist — rebuilds and exercises the *mutated* binary. The
fixture path is hard-coded inside the script and the inner run uses the
default `check`/`test` classification, so self-mutation cannot recurse.

## JSON report schema

Schema `2` records, per mutant: `id`, `path`, `line`, `column`, `offset`,
`end`, `group`, `visibility`, `original`, `replacement`, `outcome`,
`duration_ms`, `reused`, plus optional `packages`, `killed_by`, and
`attribution`. The report header carries `module`, `turtles_version`,
`moon_version`, `target`, baseline phase durations, `test_scope`, per-file
fingerprints, `skipped_files`, and `regressions`; the summary adds `reused`,
`kills_by_kind`, `property_only_kills`, and the public/private visibility
split. Schema `3` is reserved for target-aware classification
(`issues/open/2026-09-30-target-aware-mutation-testing.md`).
